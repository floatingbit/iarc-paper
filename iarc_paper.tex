\section{Introduction (5)}
The USC Aerial Robotics Team's \textit{Beohawk} quadcopter was designed to suit the requirements of the International Aerial Robotics Competition. The quadcopter uses a variety of sensors to measure and identify the environment it is in with the effort of searching for small object in a complex and unknown setting.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
For the 6th IARC mission, our quadcopter must navigate an unknown office environment to find a small flash drive, retrieve it, and return in under ten minutes while avoiding detection.  The vehicle, which must weigh under 1.5kg, must operate autonomously, which introduces the challenge of mapping and navigating an environment sensed with instruments that have random errors and noise. 

\subsection{Conceptual Solution}
The USC Aerial Robotics Team is implementing a solution based on a traditional approach to robotics with modifications for the mission and for the mechanics of the robot. The quadcopter is custom built to be within the required weight and size range but uses a commercial control board for low level control. An onboard computer uses the Robotic Operating System (ROS) and takes advantage of many of the packages and tools made available by public contributors. 

\subsubsection{Figure of Overall System Architecture}

Figure \eqref{fig:architecture} shows the basic system architecture of the quadcopter. The quadcopter's low level control including stability, attitude control, altitude control, and position control are all performed by the low-level control board. This board is an Arduino based board that has sensors and motor outputs. It also receive radio-control signals and allows control to be over-ridden by a human pilot.

The main computer is a Pico-ITX form-factor x86 based computer that handles higher level control. This computer runs ROS, which performs optical flow calculations for basic positional stability. \sout{This computer also runs the navigator that decides where the robot will move and what actions it will take. More computationally expensive processes such as SLAM, take place on an off-board computer with a more powerful processor and more memory.} Mission planning, navigation, and SLAM take place on the base station, which has a more powerful processor and more memory. The quadcopter publishes sensor data and subscribes to navigation positions from the base station.

\subsection{Yearly Milestones}
This is USC's first appearance at the IARC and our team's first competition. This year we hope to develop a platform capable of mapping and navigating the environment.  If we do not complete the goals, we will continue refining the quadcopter. \todo{eh.. feels lacking}

\section{Air Vehicle (15)}

\subsection{Propulsion and Lift System}
\emph{Beohawk} has four rotors, each an equal distance from the quadcopter's center.  Two opposite motors spin clockwise and the other two spin counter-clockwise, which generates a net torque of zero.  Hence, the quadcopter does not need a separate rotor to control yaw like a conventional helicopter, and can control yaw by adjusting the proportion of rotor speeds.  \todo{Todo: More details on these rotors}

\label{fig:navi}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Navigation}
Navigation is done in 2D using the navigation ROS package. Figure \eqref{fig:navi} shows the inputs to the navigation stack. Mission control is managed with a state machine that keeps track of the current objective.  \todo{Possibly a state diagram? To finish later}

\section{Payload (15)}
\subsection{Sensor Suite}
\subsubsection{Microsoft Kinect}
The Kinect uses an infrared laser array of 640x480 points to provide depth information at 2048 levels of sensitivity. A ROS package uses the Kinect to produce a point cloud, which gives BeoHawk a plane of vision.

\subsubsection{Camera}
The quadcopter employs a downward facing camera to detect drift. The on-board computer runs an optical flow algorithm to reduce drift. \todo{Let's see that camera}

\subsubsection{Sonar}
The quadcopter also uses sonar to determine altitude. By fixing the altitude, BeoHawk can use 2D SLAM. \todo{More about sonar}

\subsection{Man/Machine Interface}
The base station displays BeoHawk's current mission and status inferred from the sensor data returned by BeoHawk.  If the link is terminated, BeoHawk will attempt to hover in place until the connection is restored. In addition, the quadcopter will be connected to a human operator who will assume control of the quadcopter if anything goes wrong.
